PatriciaTrie.subMap() does not return the expected outcome,COLLECTIONS-695,13184962,Bug,Resolved,COLLECTIONS,Commons Collections,software,issues@commons.apache.org,,http://commons.apache.org/collections/,Major,Invalid,,kwin,kwin,13/Sep/18 17:29,09/Oct/18 10:05,23/Mar/20 17:29,09/Oct/18 10:05,4.2,,,,,,,,0,,"I use a {{PatriciaTrie}} to basically retrieve the entry whose key is the longest prefix of a requested key. 

Now I do have a simple trie with only two entries:

# {{""/libs/cq/flow/widgets"":<someothervalue>""}}

If I call {{subMap(""/"", ""/libs/cq/gui/components/authoring/dialog/""}} I would expect to only get back a map containing only entry 1. Instead I get back both entries. This happens primarily with those two specific keys. 

According to the javadoc of {{PatriciaTrie}}

The Trie can return operations in lexicographical order using the 'prefixMap', 'submap', or 'iterator' methods.

(https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/apidocs/org/apache/commons/collections4/trie/PatriciaTrie.html)

Since the latter is lexicographically ordered after the former, the outcome is like this. So this is just a misinterpretation of the ordering.",,

   After removing the last element of a MultiSet, the Entry doesn't have a count of 0. This makes the count accurate after removing the last item of a MultiSet.
