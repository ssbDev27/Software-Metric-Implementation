/***
 * RExecClient implements the rexec() facility that first appeared in
 * 4.2BSD Unix.  This class will probably only be of use for connecting
 * to Unix systems and only when the rexecd daemon is configured to run,
 * which is a rarity these days because of the security risks involved.
 * However, rexec() can be very useful for performing administrative tasks
 * on a network behind a firewall.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * As with virtually all of the client classes in org.apache.commons.net, this
 * class derives from SocketClient, inheriting its connection methods.
 * The way to use RExecClient is to first connect
 * to the server, call the {@link #rexec  rexec()} method, and then
 * fetch the connection's input, output, and optionally error streams.
 * Interaction with the remote command is controlled entirely through the
 * I/O streams.  Once you have finished processing the streams, you should
 * invoke {@link #disconnect  disconnect()} to clean up properly.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By default the standard output and standard error streams of the
 * remote process are transmitted over the same connection, readable
 * from the input stream returned by
 * {@link #getInputStream  getInputStream()}.  However, it is
 * possible to tell the rexecd daemon to return the standard error
 * stream over a separate connection, readable from the input stream
 * returned by {@link #getErrorStream  getErrorStream()}.  You
 * can specify that a separate connection should be created for standard
 * error by setting the boolean &lt;code&gt; separateErrorStream &lt;/code&gt;
 * parameter of {@link #rexec  rexec()} to &lt;code&gt; true &lt;/code&gt;.
 * The standard input of the remote process can be written to through
 * the output stream returned by
 * {@link #getOutputStream  getOutputSream()}.
