/***
 * The NNTP class is not meant to be used by itself and is provided
 * only so that you may easily implement your own NNTP client if
 * you so desire.  If you have no need to perform your own implementation,
 * you should use {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPClient}.
 * The NNTP class is made public to provide access to various NNTP constants
 * and to make it easier for adventurous programmers (or those with special
 * needs) to interact with the NNTP protocol and implement their own clients.
 * A set of methods with names corresponding to the NNTP command names are
 * provided to facilitate this interaction.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * You should keep in mind that the NNTP server may choose to prematurely
 * close a connection if the client has been idle for longer than a
 * given time period or if the server is being shutdown by the operator or
 * some other reason.  The NNTP class will detect a
 * premature NNTP server connection closing when it receives a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPReply#SERVICE_DISCONTINUED NNTPReply.SERVICE_DISCONTINUED }
 *  response to a command.
 * When that occurs, the NNTP class method encountering that reply will throw
 * an {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPConnectionClosedException}
 * .
 * &lt;code&gt;NNTPConectionClosedException&lt;/code&gt;
 * is a subclass of &lt;code&gt; IOException &lt;/code&gt; and therefore need not be
 * caught separately, but if you are going to catch it separately, its
 * catch block must appear before the more general &lt;code&gt; IOException &lt;/code&gt;
 * catch block.  When you encounter an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPConnectionClosedException}
 * , you must disconnect the connection with
 * {@link #disconnect  disconnect() } to properly clean up the
 * system resources used by NNTP.  Before disconnecting, you may check the
 * last reply code and text with
 * {@link #getReplyCode  getReplyCode } and
 * {@link #getReplyString  getReplyString }.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Rather than list it separately for each method, we mention here that
 * every method communicating with the server and throwing an IOException
 * can also throw a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.MalformedServerReplyException}
 * , which is a subclass
 * of IOException.  A MalformedServerReplyException will be thrown when
 * the reply received from the server deviates enough from the protocol
 * specification that it cannot be interpreted in a useful manner despite
 * attempts to be as lenient as possible.
