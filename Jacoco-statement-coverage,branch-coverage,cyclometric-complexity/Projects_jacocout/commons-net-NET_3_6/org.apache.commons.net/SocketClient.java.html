/**
 * The SocketClient provides the basic operations that are required of
 * client objects accessing sockets.  It is meant to be
 * subclassed to avoid having to rewrite the same code over and over again
 * to open a socket, close a socket, set timeouts, etc.  Of special note
 * is the {@link #setSocketFactory  setSocketFactory }
 * method, which allows you to control the type of Socket the SocketClient
 * creates for initiating network connections.  This is especially useful
 * for adding SSL or proxy support as well as better support for applets.  For
 * example, you could create a
 * {@link javax.net.SocketFactory} that
 * requests browser security capabilities before creating a socket.
 * All classes derived from SocketClient should use the
 * {@link #_socketFactory_  _socketFactory_ } member variable to
 * create Socket and ServerSocket instances rather than instantiating
 * them by directly invoking a constructor.  By honoring this contract
 * you guarantee that a user will always be able to provide his own
 * Socket implementations by substituting his own SocketFactory.
