Your example shows one way to use the IteratorChain more efficiently.

I am no longer using the API.  The issue for me is that tried to use the API via the IteratorUtils chainedIterator method, which returns an Iterator.   Since it returns an iterator, my natural inclination was to chain that iterator with any future iterators.  I'm sure the IteratorUtils can be updated to work as expected.   If it cannot for some reason, then the javadocs should be updated to indicate the correct way to use the API.  At least that is how I would handle it.",,,,,,

Current version of Guava's {{Lists.partition()}} handle this correctly, so perhaps the code for {{ListUtils.partition()}} needs to be updated based on the latest Guava code.

A simple illustration of this:
{code}
List<String> aList = Arrays.asList(""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"");
List<List<String>> partitioned = ListUtils.partition(aList, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
System.out.println(""Number of partitions: "" + partitioned.size());

    COLLECTIONS-661: fix for concurrency issue in HashSetValuedHashMapTest

    The `getMap()` method, when testing a `HashSetValuedHashMap`, would return an object of this type. Which is an instance of `SetValuedMap`.
    
    Running it in debug mode would - most of the times - run the tests and succeed. Running normally - especially on Windows - would result in intermittent, but very frequent, failures.
    
    The `getMap()` method sometimes, depending on the order and execution of tests, will be null. So the collection added to the map will be either a `Hashset`, or a `Arrays$ArrayList`. When the types are different, `hashCode()` and `equals()` calls return incorrect values, resulting in the errors we have seen in COLLECTIONS-661.
    
    A good solution would be to re-design the tests. The `TestMultiValuedMapAsMap` is testing `MultiValuedMap`'s, which include `HashSetValuedHashMap`. However, some of its methods contain extra logic for when the type under test has some characteristics like being an instance of `SetValuedMap`.
    
    It might be possible to come up with a better design, where there are multiple test classes, for `MultiValuedMap`'s that use `SetValuedMap`'s; `MultieValuedMap`'s that use `List`'s, and so it goes.
    
    Or we could add a class to the parent class, with a flag defining the type under test. For now, I have used the `makeObject()` method, which returns the collection under test. Then I validate its instance type. There is also a comment above the code to indicate why we are using `makeObject()` and not `getMap()`.
    
    It was a fun ticket. Happy to get feedback on better solutions, or feel free to edit this pull request if you have right to it, or merge if you are happy and it has gathered some consensus.

ListOrderedSet remove(),COLLECTIONS-595,13007463,Bug,Resolved,COLLECTIONS,Commons Collections,software,issues@commons.apache.org,,http://commons.apache.org/collections/,Major,Not A Bug,,maleven,maleven,25/Sep/16 21:08,24/May/17 09:52,23/Mar/20 17:29,24/May/17 09:52,4.1,,,,Set,,0,,,,"Hello Apache,

I have a class which overrides equals() and hashCode().
I create a ListOrderedSet<MyClass> mySet= new ListOrderedSet<MyClass>(), and add objects to it:
mySet.add(obj1);
etc.

Each object is initialized in the constructor with two properties first. The other properties are set afterwards, when
they are already contained in the ListOrderedSet. After I change/add some properties, then if I do mySet.contains(obj1), false is returned.
I read about that when a hashmap is created with the objects inside and then changing the objects inside it does not change
the hasmap's internal hashcode for the objects or something like that.

These properties are found in the equals and hashcode. (When not there is no issue.).

The following happens. If I still want to remove an object which was changed afterwards, in the method: public E remove(final int index),
inside public E remove(final int index) false is returned. But the object is still removed and in the debugger the following can be seen:

DEBUG Info:

this.collections.map.size == 5 (internal HashMap)
this.collections.setOrder.size == 4. (internal ArrayList)

Afterwards if I print the list with the overrided toString() method IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown when getting the size of mySet
via mySet.size(), but not when I use an iterator to count the objects in the set.

{code:java}
    public int getSize() {
    	
    	OrderedIterator it = mySet.iterator();
    	int i = 0;
    	while(it.hasNext()){
    		
    		it.next();
		i++;
    		
    	}
//if i return i then the items are 4, when returning memorySet.size(), the items are 5.
//    	return i;
        return mySet.size();

    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {

        String toReturn = ""\n"";
 

        for (int i = 0; i < getSize(); i++) {


            toReturn = toReturn + mySet.get(i) + ""\n"";


        }
        return toReturn;

    }
{code}

So my question is: is this a bug or is it because of my changing/updating the objects in the list, and why if it returns false when removing it got deleted anyway?
Should it not got deleted to start with? 

Thank you for your effort.

P.S. I am a self taught programmer. It's my first time sending a bug issue, maybe it's a bit long or I did not send with it other information I should have.

More uniform safe-null methods in CollectionUtils,COLLECTIONS-604,13075163,Bug,Open,COLLECTIONS,Commons Collections,software,issues@commons.apache.org,,http://commons.apache.org/collections/,Minor,,kinow,kinow,kinow,26/May/17 12:41,12/Nov/19 08:27,23/Mar/20 17:29,,4.1,,,,Collection,,1,,,,"Currently, there are 65 public methods in `CollectionUtils`. And 53 without the deprecated ones. Out of these, 24 handle `null` arguments. The remaining methods throw a `NullPointerException` (NPE) at some part of its code.

The methods that handle nulls, throw NPE, or return empty columns, boolean values, or just doesn't do anything.

As a user of the API, I would expect a more uniform behaviour across the methods of `CollectionUtils`. COLLECTIONS-600 address one of these methods.

`removeAll` (2x) and `retainAll` (2x) both state that a NPE will be thrown if either parameter is `null`. However, they never check if the values are null, and instead allow the code to run until a NPE is thrown.

And the following code shows that `isEmpty` and `isFull` behave differently too.

{code:java}
Collection<String> c = null;
System.out.println(CollectionUtils.isEmpty(c)); // return true
System.out.println(CollectionUtils.isFull(c));  // throws a NPE
{code}

If I don't have to worry about `null`s with `#isEmpty`, I would expect the same from its related-method `#isFull`.

What would be a good approach for it? Define a behaviour to all methods? Or leave as is, but add more documentation?

There are a few methods that can easily be updated to check for `null` values. Others would require a bit more thinking. An example if the method in question for COLLECTIONS-600. It checks equality of collections, and when both collections are `null`, it says that they are equals.

I liked your arguments for an approach that follows the behaviour in `StringUtils`.

[~tn], any feedback on this? We might change some JavaDocs, and make it null-safe in some cases, without breaking binary compatibility, but still changing the behaviour. I was reading the last updates in the tickets, and I think we drove the design of many changes in 4.x. So if you have anything in mind I'd appreciate any feedback before we start changing the code. Later we may look at other classes to make this behaviour consistent across the whole [collections] component.

Deletions/insertions get lost in the ReplacementsFinder if they're at the end of the compared sequences,COLLECTIONS-592,12980680,Bug,Open,COLLECTIONS,Commons Collections,software,issues@commons.apache.org,,http://commons.apache.org/collections/,Minor,,,Unda,Unda,19/Jun/16 22:19,20/Jun/16 07:31,23/Mar/20 17:29,,4.0,4.1,,,,,0,,,,"In the {{sequence}} package, when comparing 2 lists with a {{SequencesComparator}} and visiting the {{EditScript}} with a {{ReplacementsFinder}}, pending deletions and insertions get lost in the {{ReplacementsFinder}} when they're at the end of the sequences.

The {{ReplacementsFinder}} stores the deletions and insertions until it encounters a {{KeepCommand}}, when it flushes the pending commands by triggering the {{handleReplacement}} method of its {{ReplacementHandler}}.

The problem is, when edit commands are at the end of the sequences, the {{ReplacementsFinder}} will never encounter a {{KeepCommand}} to flush them, so they're stuck here and will never be handed over the {{ReplacementHandler}}.

To fix this behavior in client code, one can manually call {{ReplacementsFinder.visitKeepCommand(null)}} after the {{EditScript.visit()}} call.

I patched this bug in the library by adding a {{CommandVisitor.endOfVisit}} method and calling it at the end of the {{EditScript.visit}} method, so it allows to flush the pending deletions/insertions in the {{ReplacementsFinder}} when the end of the {{EditScript}} is reached.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"19/Jun/16 22:20;Unda;ReplacementsFinder.patch;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12811732/ReplacementsFinder.patch",,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,Patch,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,2016-06-19 22:19:09.0,,,,,,,"0|i2zpnr:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Undocumented performance issue in the retainAll method in CollectionUtils ,COLLECTIONS-544,12766767,Bug,Closed,COLLECTIONS,Commons Collections,software,issues@commons.apache.org,,http://commons.apache.org/collections/,Trivial,Fixed,,oswaldo_o,oswaldo_o,12/Jan/15 05:55,27/Nov/15 21:11,23/Mar/20 17:29,12/Jan/15 14:06,4.1,,,4.1,Collection,,0,Collections,documentaion,performance,"The method {{retainAll}} in {{CollectionUtils}} is inefficient when the parameter collection has a slow containment method.

The following is the current implementation with its documentation:

        return ListUtils.retainAll(collection, retain);
    }

We can notice the inefficiency by looking at the {{retainAll}} method in {{ListUtils}}.

The {{retainAll}} method from {{ListUtils}} is implemented and documented as follows:

{noformat}
  /**
     * Returns a List containing all the elements in <code>collection</code>
     * that are also in <code>retain</code>. The cardinality of an element <code>e</code>
     * in the returned list is the same as the cardinality of <code>e</code>

     * the collection <code>c</code> and thus cannot call <code>collection.retainAll(retain);</code>.
     * <p>
     * This implementation iterates over <code>collection</code>, checking each element in
     * turn to see if it's contained in <code>retain</code>. If it's contained, it's added
     * to the returned list. As a consequence, it is advised to use a collection type for
     * <code>retain</code> that provides a fast (e.g. O(1)) implementation of
     * {@link Collection#contains(Object)}.
     *
     * @param <E>  the element type
     * @param collection  the collection whose contents are the target of the #retailAll operation
     * @param retain  the collection containing the elements to be retained in the returned collection
     * @return a <code>List</code> containing all the elements of <code>c</code>
     * that occur at least once in <code>retain</code>.
     * @throws NullPointerException if either parameter is null

     */
    public static <E> List<E> retainAll(final Collection<E> collection, final Collection<?> retain) {
        final List<E> list = new ArrayList<E>(Math.min(collection.size(), retain.size()));

        for (final E obj : collection) {
            if (retain.contains(obj)) {
                list.add(obj);
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
{noformat}

In the case of {{ListUtils#retainAll}}, the inefficiency is properly documented.

Perhaps the disclaimer about potential inefficiencies depending on the type 
of the parameter collection in ListUtils:retainAll should also be included in {{CollectionUtils#retainAll}}.",Ubuntu 14.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-01-12 12:02:05.299,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Mon Jan 12 14:06:25 UTC 2015,,,,,,,"0|i248x3:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"12/Jan/15 12:02;kinow;Updated the issue formatting code.","12/Jan/15 14:06;tn;Documented in r1651098.
